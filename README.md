# AB_UNET
## Active Bayesian UNET for image segmentation :
Active Bayesian U-net is a promising active learning process for image segmentation. Weâ€™re going to implement this method and test it on a new segmentation dataset for human embryos. First, we are going to test the model on the whole dataset to experiment with how the model generalizes overall. Then, we are going to test the active learning part of the model and experiment with different configurations and tests.
